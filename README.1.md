# TriviaGame

The goal of **Space Trivia** is to correctly answer all of the questions by selecting the correct radio button.

Wrong answers are scored separately from questions that are not answered.

This project was a class exercise in JavaScript and jQuery, as well as some work in CSS and HTML.

**Space Trivia** was coded by me, and is maintained by me.

Notes:
The app currently has the questions & answers hard-coded in HTML.

Future development:
Dynamically generate questions/radio buttons/assign answers to radio buttons via jQuery.
Make app more mobile-friendly with larger radio buttons
